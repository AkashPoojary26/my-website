            <h2>1. Introduction to Tulunadu</h2>
            <p>
                Tulunadu (Tulu Nadu) is a historic coastal region on the southwestern coast of India, 
                today covering Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and parts of Kasaragod. Bordered by the Arabian Sea 
                to the west and the Western Ghats to the east, it has remained a culturally unique land for 
                over two thousand years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tulunadu is known for its Tulu language, powerful folk traditions, spectacular Yakshagana 
                performances, Kambala buffalo races, sacred Bhoota Kola rituals, ancient temples, cuisine, 
                and a strong maritime and trading heritage.

            <h2>2. Geographic Origin and Early Identity</h2>
            <p>
                The name “Tulu Nadu” comes from the people who speak the Tulu language. Ancient inscriptions 
                and texts refer to this region as <i>Alvakheda</i>, <i>Mudalnadu</i> and parts as 
                <i>Kolathunadu</i>. Its natural boundaries – sea on one side and dense hills on the other – 
                helped protect and preserve its distinct customs, rituals, and language.
            </p>
            <p>
                The region’s rivers – Netravati, Gurupura, Swarna, Sita and others – nourished fertile lands, 
                making rice, coconut and arecanut cultivation central to life in Tulunadu.

            <h2>3. Early Inhabitants and Pre-Historic Roots</h2>
            <p>
                Archaeological evidence from megalithic burial sites, pottery, coins and tools suggests that 
                Tulunadu was inhabited from the Stone and Iron Ages. Various indigenous communities such as 
                Bunts, Billavas, Mogaveeras, Poojari communities and others have deep roots in this land.
            </p>
            <p>
                The people of Tulunadu developed strong agrarian systems, marine trade and unique spiritual 
                practices long before formal kingdoms appeared.

            <h2>4. Alupa Dynasty (c. 200 – 1400 CE)</h2>
            <p>
                The Alupa dynasty is central to Tulunadu’s recorded history. They ruled the region for nearly 
                1200 years, making them one of the longest-ruling dynasties in South India. Their capitals 
                included Mangaluru, Barkuru, and Udyavara at different periods.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Alupas had their own coinage, naval forces and trade routes. They encouraged temple building, 
                marine trade and early forms of Yakshagana and Daiva worship. Many Shaiva, Shakta and Jain 
                temples and basadis grew under their patronage.
            </p>
            <p>
                They maintained political independence while maintaining respectful ties with larger empires like 
                the Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas and Hoysalas. Strong coastal defenses, fertile lands and maritime 
                trade helped them remain stable for centuries.

        <section class="history-block">
            <h2>5. Jain Influence in Tulunadu</h2>
            <p>
                Tulunadu was once a major centre of Jainism. Jain basadis and monuments can be seen at Barkuru, 
                Moodabidri, Karkala and many other places. The famous <b>Thousand Pillar Basadi</b> in Moodabidri 
                and the <b>Gomateshwara statue</b> at Karkala stand as proof of Jain artistic and spiritual influence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many Alupa and local chieftains supported Jain scholars, architecture, and education. Jainism 
                contributed richly to Tulunadu’s art, literature and administrative ethics.

        <section class="history-block">
            <h2>6. Tulu Language and Ancient Script</h2>
            <p>
                Tulu is one of the oldest Dravidian languages, with a spoken history believed to be older than 
                many modern regional languages. A unique <b>Tulu script</b>, influenced by Grantha and early 
                Malayalam scripts, was used historically in temple records, Bhoota Kola texts, and spiritual works.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ancient Tulu works include local versions of <i>Mahabharata</i>, <i>Devi Mahatme</i> and other 
                spiritual texts. The language continues to thrive today in conversations, cinema, theatre and 
                folklore, and there is a growing movement to get Tulu recognised in the Eighth Schedule of the 
                Indian Constitution.

            <h2>7. Daiva Aradhane and Bhoota Kola</h2>
            <p>
                One of Tulunadu’s most unique spiritual traditions is <b>Daiva Aradhane</b> – worship of divine 
                spirits known as <i>Daivas</i>. This is expressed dramatically through <b>Bhoota Kola</b>, an 
                ancient ritual that combines trance, dance, music and deep faith.
            </p>
            <p>
                The performer, after elaborate costumes and preparations, enters a trance and is believed to 
                become the Daiva. People then seek justice, blessings and solutions to problems. The Daivas 
                such as <b>Panjurli</b>, <b>Guliga</b>, <b>Jumadi</b>, <b>Kodamanithaya</b> and 
                <b>Koti–Chennaya</b> are considered protectors of the land.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bhoota Kola is not just a ritual; it is an oral archive of history, law, and social ethics in 
                Tulunadu, preserved through songs known as <i>Paaddanas</i>.

            <h2>8. Yakshagana – Theatre of the Soil</h2>
            <p>
                Yakshagana is a vibrant dance-theatre form that evolved in Tulunadu over a thousand years. 
                It combines music, dance, dialogue, costume, and epic storytelling, often performed in open-air 
                stages throughout the night.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two main styles:
                <br><br>
                <b>Badagu Thittu</b> – Northern style with heavy crowns and elaborate costumes. <br>
                <b>Tenku Thittu</b> – Southern style with more natural makeup and acrobatic movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stories from the Mahabharata, Ramayana, Puranas and local legends are brought alive with energy, 
                humour and devotion. Yakshagana is one of the strongest cultural symbols of Tulunadu.

            <p>
                Kambala is a traditional buffalo race held in water-filled paddy fields. It began as a way to 
                thank the gods for protecting crops and later evolved into a major sporting and cultural event.
            </p>
            <p>
                Farmers decorate their prized buffaloes and race them on parallel muddy tracks. The sound of 
                drums, cheering crowds and the sight of speeding buffaloes through water make Kambala a thrilling 
                spectacle that has now gained recognition across India and the world.

            <p>
                After the Alupa dynasty faded, Tulunadu came under the influence of the <b>Vijayanagara Empire</b>. 
                The region became an important coastal defence and trade zone. Temples, forts and towns grew in 
                importance during this period.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later, the <b>Keladi (Ikkeri) Nayakas</b> took control of the region. They repaired forts, supported 
                temples, allowed Arab traders to operate, and maintained law and order. Rulers like <b>Shivappa Nayaka</b> 
                are remembered for agrarian reforms and governance.

            <p>
                From the 16th century onwards, Portuguese and other European traders began to visit the west coast, 
                including Tulunadu. They introduced new trading systems, architecture, churches and schools, but also 
                faced resistance from local rulers.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the late 18th century, <b>Tippu Sultan</b> of Mysore took control of Tulunadu after the decline 
                of the Keladi Nayakas. Under his rule, ports and roads developed further and spice trade expanded. 
                However, this period also saw religious tensions and wars with the British.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tippu’s death in 1799 ended Mysore control over Tulunadu and paved the way for full British rule.

        <!-- 14. KOTI–CHENNAYA LEGEND -->
        <section class="history-block" id="koti-chennaya">
            <h2>14. Koti–Chennaya: Legendary Heroes of Tulunadu</h2>
            <p>
                Among all the legends of Tulunadu, the story of <b>Koti and Chennaya</b> shines the brightest. 
                They are celebrated as twin warrior-heroes who stood for justice, equality and protection of the poor, 
                and are today worshipped as Daivas across Tulunadu.
            </p>

            <h3>Birth and Early Life</h3>
            <p>
                The legend begins with <b>Deyi Baidyethi</b> of Padumale, a woman known for her purity, strength 
                and healing abilities. Through divine blessing, she gave birth to twin sons, Koti and Chennaya, 
                believed to be children of the Sun God. Though society questioned her, her character remained 
                unquestioned, and the twins were raised with strong values of honesty and bravery.
            </p>
            <p>
                Growing up in hardship, the twins worked in fields, trained in wrestling, and became protectors 
                of villagers. Deyi Baidyethi’s teachings – to always stand by Dharma and never accept injustice – 
                shaped their destiny.
            </p>

            <h3>Rise as Warriors</h3>
            <p>
                As young men, Koti and Chennaya participated in local wrestling competitions and defeated all strong 
                challengers. Their fame reached the local ruler, who invited them into his service. They became 
                palace warriors and guards, admired for their strength and fairness.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, their growing popularity created jealousy among certain nobles and ministers in the royal 
                court, especially a man named <b>Kinnidajja</b>, who began plotting against them.
            </p>

            <h3>The Struggle for Justice</h3>
            <p>
                One day, a poor farmer approached the twins, complaining of injustice by a powerful landlord 
                named <b>Arasethimmaya</b>. The landlord was seizing land, exploiting workers and abusing power.
                Koti and Chennaya decided to stand by the oppressed villagers.
            </p>
            <p>
                They confronted the landlord, defeated his men and restored the land to the rightful farmers. 
                This heroic act won them the love of the people, but also made powerful enemies in the court.
            </p>

            <h3>Betrayal and Final Battle</h3>
            <p>
                Kinnidajja poisoned the king’s mind, claiming that the twins wanted to overthrow him. Misled and 
                suspicious, the king turned against Koti and Chennaya. Soldiers were sent to capture them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Refusing to surrender to injustice, the twins chose to fight. A fierce battle broke out in the 
                forests of Tulunadu. Outnumbered, Koti and Chennaya fought bravely till their last breath, 
                standing side by side as true brothers and warriors of Dharma.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, through betrayal and overwhelming force, they were martyred. Their death created a wave 
                of grief and anger among the people of Tulunadu.
            </p>

            <h3>From Warriors to Divine Protectors</h3>
            <p>
                After their death, the Daivas and people of the land recognized that Koti and Chennaya were 
                not ordinary humans. Their courage, sacrifice and sense of justice made them eternal protectors 
                of Tulunadu.
            </p>
            <p>
                They were elevated to the status of Daivas, and <b>Garadis</b> (shrines) dedicated to Koti–Chennaya 
                were established across Tulunadu – especially in Kumbla, Manjeshwar and many other places.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Koti–Chennaya are worshipped with great devotion. Their story is sung in Paaddanas, 
                performed in Bhoota Kola rituals and remembered as the symbol of:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bravery and courage</li>
                <li>Justice for the weak</li>
                <li>Brotherhood and loyalty</li>
                <li>Resistance to oppression</li>
                <li>Protection of Dharma</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For the people of Tulunadu, Koti–Chennaya are not just legends, but living guardians and 
                the soul of Tulu identity.

            <h2>16. Tulunadu Today and Tomorrow</h2>
            <p>
                Tulunadu today stands as a unique blend of ancient culture and modern progress. Its temples, 
                rituals, festivals and heroes like Koti–Chennaya keep the spirit of the land alive, while 
                its schools, colleges, businesses and technology centres shape its future.
            </p>
            <p>
                As long as its people continue to respect their roots – language, rituals, heroes and history – 
                Tulunadu will remain a land of pride, courage and living heritage.
