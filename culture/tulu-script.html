    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Tulu is one of the oldest Dravidian languages, spoken primarily in the coastal districts 
        of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and parts of Kasaragod. With a history stretching over 
        2,000 years, Tulu has a rich oral and literary heritage that has been preserved through 
        folklore, songs, rituals and inscriptions.
    </p>

    <p>
        While today Tulu is written in the Kannada script in everyday use, 
        the language originally had its own <b>unique script</b> — an elegant writing system 
        used in palm-leaf manuscripts, temple archives and religious texts of Tulunadu.  
        Many of these manuscripts still survive, offering insights into ancient cultural life.
    </p>

    <p>
        The language remains vibrant today through cinema, theatre, 
        Paddanas (oral epics), Yakshagana performances and digital literature.

    <!-- ORIGIN -->
    <div class="acc-item">
        <button class="acc-btn">Origin of Tulu Script</button>
        <div class="acc-content">
            <p>
                The Tulu script has its roots in the ancient <b>Brahmi</b> family of writing systems
                and gradually evolved through the early <b>Grantha</b> script used in southern India.
                Because Tulunadu had strong cultural and trade connections with Kerala and Tamil regions,
                the script developed rounded shapes similar to Malayalam and Grantha characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                The script was widely used between the 12th and 18th centuries in temple documents,
                educational manuscripts, palm-leaf records and Daiva/ritual texts. Traders, priests,
                astrologers and scholars of the region used the script extensively in their daily work.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- EVOLUTION -->
    <div class="acc-item">
        <button class="acc-btn">Evolution Over Time</button>
        <div class="acc-content">
            <p>
                Tulu script evolved primarily due to the medium on which it was written —
                <b>palm leaves</b>. Straight lines could tear the leaf, so scribes naturally
                developed smooth circular strokes, resulting in the script’s beautiful curves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, administrative systems shifted and Kannada became the mainstream writing
                script in schools and government offices. As a result, the original Tulu script slowly
                faded from everyday use but continued to survive in temples, families and oral traditions.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- TEMPLE USAGE -->
    <div class="acc-item">
        <button class="acc-btn">Temple & Ritual Usage</button>
        <div class="acc-content">
            <p>
                The strongest preservation of Tulu script is found in sacred spaces. Temple priests
                used it for recording festivals, donations, ancestral lists, and rituals associated
                with <b>Daiva Aradhane</b>. Many palm-leaf manuscripts describing the origins and
                duties of local Daivas were written in pure Tulu script.
            </p>
            <p>
                In particular, the Paddanas — long narrative songs of heroes, spirits and deities —
                were sometimes documented in the script to preserve oral traditions. This made the
                script not just a writing system, but a guardian of the region’s spiritual identity.

    <!-- REVIVAL -->

        <div class="acc-content">
            <p>
                In the last two decades, scholars, cultural organisations and Tulu enthusiasts have
                taken major steps to revive the script. Workshops are being conducted in schools,
                new digital fonts have been created, and historic manuscripts are being scanned
                for preservation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Social media, cinema and digital communities have brought new life to the language.
                Many groups are campaigning for Tulu to be included in the <b>8th Schedule</b> of the
                Indian Constitution, which would give the language national recognition and support.
