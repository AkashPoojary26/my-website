        <h2>What is Pili Nalike?</h2>
        <p>
          Pili Nalike (Tiger Dance) is one of the most recognisable folk dance
          traditions of Tulunadu. Performers paint their entire body with tiger
          stripes, wear masks or facial makeup, and dance in sync with loud
          drums in streets and temple surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dance is especially popular during <b>Navaratri</b>,
          <b>Dasara</b> and local temple fairs in Mangaluru, Udupi and
          surrounding regions. It symbolizes power, courage and celebration.

    <!-- ORIGIN + SIGNIFICANCE (FULL WIDTH BLOCK) -->
    <section class="pili-origin">
      <h2>Origins & Significance</h2>
      <p>
        Pili Nalike is deeply connected to the agrarian and temple culture of
        Tulunadu. Traditionally, teams of performers would visit homes, shops
        and temples, dancing in return for offerings. The tiger, considered a
        powerful and divine creature, is invoked to bring protection, strength
        and prosperity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, Pili Nalike has grown from a purely ritual performance into a
        major cultural symbol of coastal Karnataka, while still retaining its
        spiritual and community roots.
